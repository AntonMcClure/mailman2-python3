"""Rebuild a list's archive.

Use this command to rebuild the archives for a mailing list.  You may want to
do this if you edit some messages in an archive, or remove some messages from
an archive.

Usage: %(PROGRAM)s [options] <listname> [<mbox>]

Where options are:
    -h / --help
        Print this help message and exit.

    -q / --quiet
        Make the archiver output less verbose.

    --wipe
        First wipe out the original archive before regenerating.  You usually
        want to specify this argument unless you're generating the archive in
        chunks.

    -s N
    --start=N
        Start indexing at article N, where article 0 is the first in the mbox.
        Defaults to 0.

    -e M
    --end=M
        End indexing at article M.  This script is not very efficient with
        respect to memory management, and for large archives, it may not be
        possible to index the mbox entirely.  For that reason, you can specify
        the start and end article numbers.

Where <mbox> is the path to a list's complete mbox archive.  Usually this will
be some path in the archives/private directory.  For example:

%% bin/arch mylist archives/private/mylist.mbox/mylist.mbox

<mbox> is optional.  If it is missing, it is calculated.
