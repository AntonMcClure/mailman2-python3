BACKGROUND:
  Many people are not ready or able to migrate easily from MM2 -> MM3
  so this is a port of MM2 -> python3.  Expect things like localization
  and international language support to not work as expected.  MM2
  had it's own binary version of unicode support while python3 supports
  this natively.  As e-mail is a lot of text so this means a lot of
  minor touches.

* Progress update - 20230109
- I have it successfully reading and operating the user-inteface
  for login, including the majority of the CLI based tools with
  an existing set of lists.
- It still will not properly update configuration files and state
- There are many places where variables are used inline that may need
  attention, i'm not very familar with the C_ methods, so someone
  who knows more would be helpful here.

NOTES: PULL REQUESTS WELCOME :-)
