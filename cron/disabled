"""Process disabled members, recommended once per day.

This script cruises through every mailing list looking for members whose
delivery is disabled.  If they have been disabled due to bounces, they will
receive another notification, or they may be removed if they've received the
maximum number of notifications.

Use the --byadmin, --byuser, and --unknown flags to also send notifications to
members whose accounts have been disabled for those reasons.  Use --all to
send the notification to all disabled members.

Usage: %(PROGRAM)s [options]

Options:
    -h / --help
        Print this message and exit.

    -o / --byadmin
        Also send notifications to any member disabled by the list
        owner/administrator.

    -m / --byuser
        Also send notifications to any member disabled by themselves.

    -u / --unknown
        Also send notifications to any member disabled for unknown reasons
        (usually a legacy disabled address).

    -b / --notbybounce
        Don't send notifications to members disabled because of bounces (the
        default is to notify bounce disabled members).

    -a / --all
        Send notifications to all disabled members.

    -f / --force
        Send notifications to disabled members even if they're not due a new
        notification yet.

    -l listname
    --listname=listname
        Process only the given list, otherwise do all lists.
